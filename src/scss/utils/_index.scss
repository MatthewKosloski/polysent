// Utilities
// =========
//
// The utils folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. 
// Every variable, function, mixin, and placeholder should be put in here. 
// 
// The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line 
// of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.
